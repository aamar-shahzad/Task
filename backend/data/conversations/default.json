It combines aspects of computer science, statistics, mathematics, domain expertise, and visualization to understand and interpret complex data.  Data scientists use various techniques, including machine learning, data mining, and database management, to analyze large datasets, identify patterns, build predictive models, and ultimately make data-driven decisions.  Think of it as using powerful tools to find meaningful information hidden within massive amounts of data, allowing businesses and organizations to improve efficiency, make better predictions, and gain a competitive edge.  The process often involves cleaning, preparing, and transforming data before analysis, followed by interpreting the results and communicating findings to stakeholders.",
