      "text": "In the world of AI, RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.  It's a technique that lets AI models access and process external information, like documents or databases, to enhance their responses.  This helps them answer questions more accurately and provide more relevant information than they could using only their existing knowledge.  Essentially, it gives AI a better memory and broader understanding.",
